# AssetConfig

Asset Config takes care of the small things. Control the production and management of .htaccess, sitemaps, robots.txt, vCards, and other unique web formats.

Supporting over 30 formats and many further compatible standards, this is the most comprehensive tool of it's kind. Each wizard in the toolbox will generate the file you need easily (and it's all done on your machine, as these tools are privacy focused).

Best of all, if you want to detach yourself from the toolchain entirely and compile the files yourself, I've written a comprehensive book on the subject which goes behind the scenes on every format thats included here and how to render them performantly.

## Tiny.txt

I've also [written an eBook](https://assetconfig.com/#download) which describes in detail, how to take advantage of these tiny files (if you prefer learning about the mechanics rather than using a generator). Plus I've given a discussion on the subject, and the slides are [available here](https://assetconfig.com/cache/file/talk.pdf).
